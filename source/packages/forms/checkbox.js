/**
 * <p>The <tt>Forms.Checkbox</tt> class can be used to 'hijack' checkbox inputs in HTML forms to
 * make them easier to style using CSS. The checkbox inputs themselves become hidden (they are positioned
 * off-screen rather than hidden using <tt>display</tt> or <tt>visibility</tt>) and their labels
 * have their class names changed to mirror changes to the inputs as the user interacts with the form.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class is designed as a light-weight and unobtrusive replacement for <tt>YAHOO.util.Button</tt>
 * for the simple case where you want to style your form inputs and retain programmatic access to them.
 * It encourages accessible markup through use of <tt>label</tt> elements, and does not alter the HTML
 * structure of your form in any way.</p>
 *
 * @constructor
 * @class Forms.Checkbox
