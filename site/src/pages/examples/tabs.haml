                <p>I believe in the power of the imagination to remake the
                world, to release the truth within us, to hold back the night,
                to transcend death, to charm motorways, to ingratiate ourselves
                with birds, to enlist the confidences of madmen.</p>
                
                <p>I believe in my own obsessions, in the beauty of the car
                crash, in the peace of the submerged forest, in the excitements
                of the deserted holiday beach, in the elegance of automobile
                graveyards, in the mystery of multi-storey car parks, in the
                poetry of abandoned hotels.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><q>We do not move in one direction, rather do we wander back and
                forth, turning now this way and now that. We go back on our own
                tracks&hellip;</q> That thought of Montaigne's reminds me about
                something I thought of in connection with flying saucers,
                humanoids, and the remains of unbelievably advanced technology
                found in some ancient ruins. They write about aliens, but I think
                that in these phenomena we are in fact confronting ourselves;
                that is our future, our descendants who are actually traveling in
                time.</p>

                <p>I ask in my writing, What is real? Because unceasingly we
                are bombarded with pseudo-realities manufactured by very
                sophisticated people using very sophisticated electronic
                mechanisms. I do not distrust their motives; I distrust their
                power. They have a lot of it. And it is an astonishing power:
                that of creating whole universes, universes of the mind.</p>
