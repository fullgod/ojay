  h3. The structure of Ojay
  
  Ojay is packaged as a series of JavaScript files that provide different modules of the library. When you download Ojay, you'll
  be presented with the following folder structure:
  
  <ul>
    <li>@/lib@
      <ul>
        <li>@class.js@</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>@/pkg@
      <ul>
        <li>@history.js@</li>
        <li>@http.js@</li>
        <li>@mouse.js@</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>@core.js@</li>
    <li>@all.js@</li>
  </ul>
  
  Let's go through each folder:
  
  h3. @lib@
  
  The @lib@ directory contains files from external projects that Ojay depends on. @class.js@ comes from James Coglan's
  "@JS.Class@":http://jsclass.jcoglan.com project, which provides an easy-to-use object orientation framework and some design
  patterns for use with JavaScript. The distribution included with Ojay includes the @Observer@ and @State@ patterns.
  
  The file @/lib/class.js@ is required by the Ojay core, and must be included before it on your web pages.
  
  h3. @pkg@
  
  The @pkg@ directory contains 'packages' - add-ons to the Ojay core that provide specialised pieces of functionality. These
  currently include:
  
  * @history.js@ - A wrapper for @YAHOO.util.History@ for back button management
  * @http.js@ - A wrapper for @YAHOO.util.Connect@ for Ajax
  * @mouse.js@ - Tracks mouse movements and provides @mouseenter@/@mouseleave@ events
  
  h3. @core@
  
  @core.js@ contains the Ojay core libraries. These provide DOM manipulation, event management, animation, and some extensions
  to JavaScript's @Array@, @String@ and @Function@ classes.
  
  @all.js@ includes everything in the download in a single file. It's a little large, but you can use it if you don't
  want to worry about dependencies.
  
  h3. A typical page setup
  
  Here's a list of files you'd typically include in your page to get Ojay running:
  
  * @http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.4.1/build/yahoo-dom-event/yahoo-dom-event.js@
  * @http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.4.1/build/selector/selector-beta-min.js@
  * @http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.4.1/build/animation/animation-min.js@
  * @http://yoursite.com/ojay/lib/class.js@
  * @http://yoursite.com/ojay/core.js@
  
  If you're using Ajax, include these:
  
  * @http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.4.1/build/connection/connection-min.js@
  * @http://yoursite.com/ojay/pkg/http.js@
  
  If you need back-button management, include these:
  
  * @http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.4.1/build/history/history-min.js@
  * @http://yoursite.com/ojay/pkg/history.js@
