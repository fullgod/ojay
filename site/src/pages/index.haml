  h3. What is it?
  
  Ojay is an open-source JavaScript library developed by London web agency "the OTHER media":http://othermedia.com.
  It acts as a wrapper for the "Yahoo! User Interface":http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ library, providing a more
  intuitive programming model and some additional features. It is built for compatibility with YUI 2.4.0 onwards,
  and is released under "a BSD-style license":/license.html
  
  <div id="example">
  <a id="run-this-code">Run this code!</a>
  <pre id="front-example">
  $('a#run-this-code').on('click', $.stopEvent)
      .setContent('Running...')
      ._('#example').animate({
          height: {to: 0},
          opacity: {from: 1, to: 0}
      }, 0.5)
      ._($.HTTP).GET('/service/hello.html')
      .insertInto('#example')
      ._('#example').animate({
          height: {to: 80},
          opacity: {from: 0, to: 1}
      }, 0.7);</pre>
  </div>
  
  h3. Download version 0.2.0
  
  The 0.1.x series is the first official release. The download includes the source code, and packed and gzipped copies
  of the build files.
  
  * "Download Ojay 0.2.0":/assets/ojay-0.2.0.zip
  
  h3. How do I use it?
  
  To start with, you'll need to include the following YUI modules on your page: @YAHOO.util.Dom@, @YAHOO.util.Event@,
  and @YAHOO.util.Selector@. The first two form the base for interacting with the page via script, and the latter is
  YUI's CSS selector engine, used by Ojay to grab element references.
  
  Various Ojay features have further dependencies - these are highlighted in the documentation for each feature.
  
  With those files in place, the following articles should get you started. YUI libraries and all of Ojay is built into every page
  of this site, so you can try stuff out in "Firebug":http://www.getfirebug.com/ as you read through the examples.
  
  h3. Development
  
  Ojay is an open-source project, released under the BSD license. You can browse the source code, file bug reports
  and contribute patches on "our Google Code site":http://ojay.googlecode.com.
