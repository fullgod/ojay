  h3. What is it?
  
  Ojay is an open-source JavaScript library developed by London web agency "the OTHER media":http://othermedia.com
  for use in all its ongoing client projects. It acts as a wrapper for "YUI":http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/,
  providing a more intuitive programming model and some additional features. It is built for compatibility with
  YUI 2.4.0 onwards, and is released under "a BSD-style license":/license.html.
  
  One of its key features is the ability to chain function calls together, even when asynchronicity is involved.
  So, you can write lists of instructions where you would normally have nested callbacks:
  
  <div id="example">
  <a id="run-this-code">Run this code!</a>
  <pre id="front-example" class="prettyprint">    $('a#run-this-code').on('click', $.stopDefault)
          .setContent('Running...')
          ._('#example').animate({  height:  {to: 0},
                                    opacity: {from: 1, to: 0}
                                 }, 0.5)
          ._($.HTTP).GET('/service/hello.html')
                    .insertInto('#example')
          ._('#example').animate({  height:  {to: 80},
                                    opacity: {from: 0, to: 1}
                                 }, 0.7);</pre>
  </div>
  
  h3. Download version 0.3.1
  
  0.3.x is largely backward-compatible with previous releases. There have been a couple of deprecations
  in the API, and additions made to the @HTTP@, @Forms@ and @Overlay@ packages. The biggest change is
  an upgrade of "JS.Class":http://jsclass.jcoglan.com to version 2.0; this does not affect the Ojay
  API but if you're using JS.Class directly yourself, consult the "upgrade notes":http://jsclass.jcoglan.com/upgrade.html.
  
  We've also added support for "multiple CSS selector libraries":/articles/selectors.html, and enhanced
  the "@Observable@":/articles/observable.html module so that events can 'bubble' up the type hierarchy
  from the objects that fire them.

  h3. How do I use it?
  
  To start with, you'll need to include the following YUI modules on your page: @YAHOO.util.Dom@, @YAHOO.util.Event@,
  and @YAHOO.util.Selector@. The first two form the base for interacting with the page via script, and the latter is
  YUI's CSS selector engine, used by Ojay to grab element references.
  
  Various Ojay features have further dependencies - these are highlighted in the documentation for each feature.
  
  With those files in place, the articles in the sidebar should get you started. YUI libraries and all of Ojay is built into every page
  of this site, so you can try stuff out in "Firebug":http://www.getfirebug.com/ as you read through the examples.
  
  h3. Development
  
  Ojay is an open-source project, released under the BSD license. You can browse the source code, file bug reports
  and contribute patches on "our Google Code site":http://ojay.googlecode.com. We also have a "mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/ojay-talk,
  or you can get in touch with the library's author at "james.coglan@othermedia.com":mailto:james.coglan@othermedia.com.
