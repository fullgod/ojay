Version 0.3.0
October [TODO] 2008
================================================================

* JS.Class updated to 2.0.2. This does not affect the Ojay API
  but will affect you if you use JS.Class explicitly yourself.
  See http://jsclass.jcoglan.com/upgrade.html

* New packages: Accordion

* Additions to core:
    * Observable now causes and event to bubble up the inheritance
      tree of the object that fired it. So you can listen to all
      instances of Paginator using Ojay.Paginator.on()

* Additions to Forms package:
    * Ojay.Forms.setValue() now selects options in drop-down
      menus based on text content, not just values

* Additions to HTTP package:
    * onSuccess callbacks can now be specified implicitly, like
      they are in jQuery. If you supply a single function (rather
      than a named list), that function is taken to be onSuccess.
      e.g.
          
          Ojay.HTTP.GET('/search', {q: 'hello'}, function(r) { ... });

* Bug fixes:
    * Ojay.HTML.input() generates inputs with the correct type in IE
    * DomCollection#setAttributes() was failing on attrs that required
      use of HTMLElement#setAttribute. This is now fixed.

* Deprecations:
    * HTTP.Response#evalScriptTags() has been removed. Use
      HTTP.Response#evalScripts().
    * DomCollection#setAttributes() has been deprecated in favour of
      the shorter DomCollection#set()


Version 0.2.1
August 6 2008
================================================================

* The first argument to Keyboard.listen() is now optional, and
  defaults to 'document'.
* Keyboard.RuleSet() can take a node to listen to as the first
  argument. This is optional and defaults to 'document'.
* Forms package does not validate fields that are hidden using
  'display: none'.


Version 0.2.0
June 13 2008
================================================================

* JS.Class upgraded to 1.6.1
* Ojay compatible with current experimental branch of JS.Class
* New packages: Forms, Keyboard, Overlay and Paginator

* Additions to the core library:
    * Ojay.delegateEvent()
    * Ojay.Observable module, allows any class to support the on() method
    * CSS queries use document.querySelectorAll() if available
    * Ojay.getVisibleRegion() returns the Region for the part of the
      page exposed by the viewport
    * Number#times() for Ruby-style looping
    * String#parseJSON(), a shortcut for YAHOO.lang.JSON.parse()
    * HtmlBuilder#concat() allows existing nodes to be inserted into
      the element between other tag calls
    * HtmlBuilder can take HTMLElements as arguments so you can nest
      elements without using functions
    * New Region scaling and translation methods

* Additions to HTTP package:
    * HTTP.Response#insertInto() can accept any object with a
      setContent() method, e.g. Overlay objects
    * HTTP includes Observable and publishes events for HTTP traffic
    * New catch-all onComplete callback for requests

* Bug fixes:
    * Opacity animations remove filters properly in IE
    * DomCollection#setContent() works with SELECT and TABLE elements
    * HTTP URL parser handles valueless parameters correctly in IE

* Deprecations
    * HTTP.Response#evalScriptTags() is deprecated and will be removed
      by version 0.3. Use HTTP.Response#evalScripts() instead.
